/**
 * @file
 * @brief -- Interface to an AES-128 implementation.
 *
 *  Overview:   AES-128 is a NIST approved block cipher specified in
 *              FIPS 197. Block ciphers are deterministic algorithms that
 *              perform a transformation specified by a symmetric key in fixed-
 *              length data sets, also called blocks.
 *
 *  Security:   AES-128 provides approximately 128 bits of security.
 *
 *  Usage:      1) call tc_aes128_set_encrypt/decrypt_key to set the key.
 *
 *              2) call tc_aes_encrypt/decrypt to process the data.
